# Deep Space Scouting Server
Server for scouting app for the 2019 FIRST Robotics Competition.

Runs with Python3 on Linux, uses Bluetooth for data transfer.

Developed by FRC Team 449: The Blair Robot Project.

### Usage

To run this server, run server.py with Python3 on a Linux computer with Bluetooth enabled, and follow the printed instructions.

Devices must be paired (but not necessarily connected) before use.

For automatic removable drive detection and copying, you must enable NOPASSWD for sudo usage. You can do this by adding `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to the end of your `/etc/sudoers` file (do this with `sudo visudo`). Be aware that this poses a major security risk, your password is no longer required to use sudo. 
You also need an empty media directory to mount to.
